# 📊 DSA Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A Python-based **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Sorting Visualizer** built using **Matplotlib** to demonstrate how popular sorting algorithms work through animated bar charts.

This project focuses on improving **conceptual understanding** of sorting algorithms by visually showing each step of the algorithm execution.

## 🚀 Features

- Animated visualization of sorting algorithms
- Color-coded steps for better clarity
- Interactive console-based menu
- Beginner-friendly and easy-to-understand code
- Modular structure with reusable visualization logic

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

- Bubble Sort  
- Selection Sort  
- Merge Sort  
- Quick Sort

## 🎨 Color Legend

| Color | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| Light Blue | Unsorted elements |
| Red | Elements being compared |
| Yellow | Current position |
| Orange | Minimum element |
| Green | Sorted elements |

> **Note:** Color coding is primarily used for Bubble Sort and Selection Sort to maintain clarity and simplicity.
